# The World Bank International Debt

## Project Description

It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, I will analyze international debt data collected by the World Bank. The data set contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) that developing countries must pay in several categories.

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2022.
